        <h3><i>Hamlet On the Holodeck</i></h3>
        <p>I really liked the idea of using VR to capture stories and prevent them from being forgotten and share with others. A lot of times it’s easy for people distance themselves from important events that happen around the world that affect real people. If something is happening on the other side of the country or world, it’s easy to forget about it in your daily life when you don’t experience it. By creating a recollection and preservation of history or current events through this media and experiencing it firsthand, it can change people’s perspective. This reminds me of another project that we took a look at in class about illegal immigration. Technology causes people to be less respectful or considerate when interacting with others. We fail to see each other’s humanity. By creating something like this for these types of topics we can bridge that gap. </p>
