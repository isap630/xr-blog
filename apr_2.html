        <h3><i>Hamlet On the Holodeck</i></h3>
        <p>This topic of transformation in regards to digital media and technology, to me, is the most controversial out of the other topics. And I interpreted it in a different way than the author wrote about it. Virtual and digital media have the ability to actually transform and manipulate our perception of reality. To the point where we have to question and be critical of it. As the author wrote, “Anything we see in digital format—words, numbers, images, moving pictures—becomes more plastic, more inviting of change.”, therefore we must be extra aware of this especially with AI coming into the picture. When it comes to AR, there are tons of filters out there that manipulate the way we view each other, this could simply just be for fun but we need to understand the implications it has. Those who may not realize or be aware of the alteration of reality it has created are vulnerable to being fed false narratives or perceptions. This also comes into question when it comes to journalism and the false narrative it can potentially create whether it's on purpose or not. When we have this “kaleidoscopic structure” where we can interact with digital media in different ways, and view the same story from different angles, it can sometimes cause a blur in what is the truth when it comes to real life incidents. When you get fed different information from different sources it’s sometimes difficult to piece it together. On the other hand, having this ability to gain information from different sources and jump around from hyperlink and trace back your steps, in regards to a story could also be really beneficial. We just have to learn to be more resourceful and learn to filter things when we are bombarded with information.</p>
