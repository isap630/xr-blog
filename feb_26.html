        <p>	Even though the content of the book itself is on the older side now, the concept of people being resistant to technological changes is still very relevant. People are still hesitant about the implications of Artificial Intelligence and how it will affect our world, both in the virtual and physical world. It's so interesting how fast people switched from being anti computer to now essentially almost everyone relies on computers in their daily lives to some degree. Most entertainment, content, and businesses rely on digital spaces whether that be for selling, advertisements, keeping records, etc. As someone who enjoys video games and digital technology design, I kinda find it sad that so many people were against creating these new digital means to share information and stories. Although I understand their sentiments about certain implications, I think that one should be open to the positives a new technology can bring. Even as virtual reality and AI continues to advance, one canâ€™t really deny the way that these technologies have begun to change society for the good, which usually outweighs the bad. This is not to say that we shouldn't criticize the usage of technology, especially if it's harmful, but you never know when one thing can revolutionize our experiences as humans. This goes back to the idea that new technology is like augmenting our physical abilities into ones that seem impossible. VR in this sense is like adding the ability to jump into our imaginations and into worlds that we create in our mind, into ones we can really interact with. </p>
