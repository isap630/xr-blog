        <h3>“Worlds Unfolding”</h3>
        <p>The idea of being intentional about each element you provide in your world is important when building it. It is important to think of the purpose of each item you bring in and how the placement will change the world for the person experiencing it. Im my A-Frame project, I really wanted it to feel as if you're experiencing landing in the Dominican Republic and understanding the different aspects of it without explicitly reading about why they are there. I tried to make my world feel more organic, rather than following a specific route or anything. The person is able to roam around and explore any part of the world they would like. I also wanted to add a few sound details to my project, like the sound of the claps when you pass the plane or the ability to play and pause the music on the beach. Based on the examples shown, I think Alt-Alterity does a good job exploring the idea of otherness and creating odd elements to show that intention. In between also does a cool job at trying to alter space and direction, which goes well with their theme of being in between or not quite at some definitive space. </p>
