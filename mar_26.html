        <h3><i>Hamlet On the Holodeck</i></h3>
        <p>This chapter talks about Agency and how certain participatory narratives may limit or expand the audience's sense of agency one has. While I was reading this chapter and even throughout the entire book, It talks a lot about video games, which makes sense since those are the types of digital stories that give the user this type of feeling. It reminded me about examples of narrative adventure games I've seen such as Detroit: Become Human, Life is Strange, Heavy Rain. All these types of games give users a sort of sense of Agency that in the end does affect how the end result, as your choices affect what ending you get. It does give you that sense that you are reliable for the outcome of these characters in the narrative. I also thought about open world games, where you don't have to necessarily follow a certain plot all of the time. I personally have played Zelda Breath of the wild and I love the aspect of unlocking the map as I navigate the space and having that choice to follow the main story, follow side quests, or even just explore areas I have not yet seen. Or even games like Minecraft where it's almost completely open world and what you choose to make of the game is completely up to you.  Sometimes when you are experiencing these games, it does feel like one is walking through a maze since you never know what you’re going to confront or what choice you have to make next. But I slightly disagree with the claim that the “maze orientation” always points the user to a single solution. Although some story games have limited choices and outcomes, I do think that there are still a lot of games with a large amount of options to how the story ends and having that burden be on the user, that their choices led to this. Especially in those adventure games I mentioned.</p>
