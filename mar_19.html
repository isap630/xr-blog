        <p>Being able to be a participant in stories through digital media has created a way for the audience to become closer to the story itself. It changes the dynamic so that the uncomfortable 4th wall break that Suzanne Langer describes, doesn't happen like it does in traditional media. How can you break the 4th wall in a story that one is already in the center of. When you’re playing a video game and a character interacts with you, it feels as if the world and quests are your own. The claim “When we enter the enchanted world as our actual selves, we risk draining it of its delicious otherness.” doesn’t feel like it applies as much anymore when it comes to digital media. As the text later says itself, the screen itself becomes a reassuring fourth wall and the gap between reality and the digital becomes smaller. That's why I think the claim “The more present the enchanted world, the more we need to be reassured that it is only virtual and the more we need to see Harold’s moon reminding us that there is a way back to the external world.” feels to become more true. As virtual reality comes into the picture, we can see how these worlds can immerse oneself deeply in them. I’ve seen countless videos of people actually falling, and bumping into things in the physical world, while they are immersed in the Virtual Reality space. Personally, the idea of being immersed in a hyper-realistic virtual world is scary. How would people tell the difference between reality and the digital as they become closer to one another?</p>
