        <h3>“Worlds Unfolding”</h3>
        <p>I like how the book encourages the reader to think about how they want the world they create  to be structured and how they want their audience to be guided through it. There's so many ways that a person can be taken through it. They can be left to explore the world as they like or be forced to go through it a certain way. This goes back to the previous section where I talked about how I made my A-Frame world where the user is free to listen to any of my audios in the world in any order they like. I could’ve made it where they would've had to listen to it in a certain order but that was a choice I made as the creator. It is important to be intentional with it to make sure your user doesn’t feel lost in it. The quote,  “We center our theme on the definition that ‘matrix’ implies the ‘environment’ where things come into being. This encompasses not just the physical surroundings, but also the historical, social, and technical context.” stood out to me. I’d like to think that all these VR worlds created are their own “matrix”, even if this is from a specific work. Every world you create is a place where you can bring to life anything and anything. We are later given an example of how people use these worlds to talk about history, like the Columbia University Library project or where you’re simply bringing in things from your childhood.</p>
