        <p>The idea that new forms of media retain attributes of older forms of media until they create something completely new on their own is interesting. It's easy to see how in the past, the internet was just an expansion of old media, such as books, movies, videos, and journals. But now the computer and internet has definitely become something completely new and has attributes that are unique to itself with the help of interactive technologies. Learning about ELIZA in this chapter has definitely made me see how much it has changed and how the interactivity of the internet, especially with AI, has changed how media is created. It's crazy how we can tell AI to create something for us and it’ll generate in seconds. That is something that no other form of previous media was able to do, even though AI does take inspiration from previous man made works to generate its own. In addition to this, the author’s Four Essential Properties of Digital Environments still stand strong today. They remain procedural, participatory, spacial, and encyclopedic. Most digital technologies are predictable and are coded in a very procedural manner and have complex algorithms behind them. They are also most of the time interactive where the user can directly interact or make changes. I like the idea of them being spacial, because even if its not a physical space, we use the internet as a space where we can share and create to farther lengths than physical space. In that sense, it defies space. But also we could say the same thing about time. It saves us so much time, we don't have to spend hours trying to look through books for research and decreases the time we would spend trying to communicate with someone across the world. This leads us to Encyclopedic, and of course you can learn about anything and everything using digital media. </p>
