        <p>I like the idea of multiform stories in relation to VR experiences. Most traditional media don't really have that option for the story having multiple outcomes or paths for the audience to go on. By creating these worlds where your path or outcome may vary based on your choices, you are expanding the possibilities of how a story or theme can be told. Hyperlinks have inherently changed the way we interact with media. We now have an easy way to jump from page to page or topic to topic, with a single click. With this you can transport your audience to different or related scenes and alter the story. Building a linear story with a non linear format is a great way to engage your user with your built world by making the user the main perspective. </p>
