        <h2>February 5th - "Inspirations"</h2>
        <h3>“Worlds Unfolding”</h3>
        <p>I think this section helps us grasp the concept of being in a virtual space in an interesting way. By taking the time to imagine and create our own world in our mind, and thinking about the details, it helps us understand the complexities of and the thought that goes into the examples before even providing them to us. Reading about these projects feels really inspirational and made me want to make my own imagined world into a real project. The concept of “world making” is interesting too, because anything that's virtual could be considered its own world. We jump into worlds by doing things like building online communities, playing video games, watching videos, and so much more. Although this text focused a lot on the positives and wonders of creating and immersing oneself in these sorts of worlds, there are still negative effects to it. One of them being addiction to technology, which can cause a disconnection to the physical world, and even a distortion of reality.</p>
        <h3>“An Account of Peach Blossom Spring”</h3>
        <p>This piece of writing makes much more sense after reading the first pages of “Worlds Unfolding”. It takes us through the story and what it would be like to take the path to this hidden community. It feels almost whimsical to imagine the blossoms and the sounds of the animals the fishman experiences in the town. I think by creating a little story such as this one, we can create a detailed narrative of what we want our virtual spaces to feel like to our audience.</p>
        <p>One thing I noticed while reading both pieces of texts is that there’s this sense of curiosity and wonder about fantastical spaces that I really want to incorporate into my future work in this class.
