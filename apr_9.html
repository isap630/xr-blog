        <p>I found this piece of work really cool to view, especially as an astronomy lover myself. I found the aesthetic really mysterious and intriguing. I would love to experience it though a VR headset myself. The critiques and themes in it are great but they do it in a captivating way. I love the dark and space aesthetic that makes it seem so mystical. As someone myself who loves creating things that are space themed, I thought it was cool. Space is a place where most of us can't even imagine going, so it makes sense why one would like to create virtual experiences about being there and experiencing. I found Hsin-Chien Huang’s concept of screens getting physically closer and closer to us over time very interesting but also scary. It's like screens and digital technology are becoming extensions of ourselves. It's scary to think that there is a possibility that they could become closer maybe through things like surgeries or something. We see people have already implanted technology in their bodies such as chips to pay for things and stuff like that. Having a permanent screen-like technology seems like a very scary possibility to me. It makes me feel that the human desire “to live in our imaginations” could lead us to something like that in the future.</p>
